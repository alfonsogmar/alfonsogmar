Hi ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my personal GitHub page!

My name is Alfonso and I'm a Computer Science undergraduate. I'm currently enrolled in a Master's degree program in Data Science and Engineering.

My main interests include software development, data engineering, data science and machine learning.

I am also looking forward to learning more about embedded systems, microcontrolers, HPC, and cybersecurity.

Feel free to check out some of my personal projects and university assignments.
