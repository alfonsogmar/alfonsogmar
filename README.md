Hi 👋, welcome to my personal GitHub page!

My name is Alfonso and I'm a data and software engineer graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Data Science and Engineering.

My main interests include software development, data engineering, data science and machine learning. However, I am also looking forward to diving further into other fields, such as embedded systems, microcontrolers, HPC, and cybersecurity.

Feel free to check out some of my personal projects and university assignments.
